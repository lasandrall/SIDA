Description: The SIDA package implements the SIDA and SIDANet algorithms for joint association and classification studies.  The algorithms consider the overall association between 
    multi-view data, and the separation within each view when choosing discriminant vectors 
    that are associated and optimally separate subjects. SIDANet incorporates prior structural information in joint association and classification studies. 
    It uses the normalized Laplacian of a graph to smooth coefficients of predictor variables, thus encouraging selection of predictors that are connected and
    behave similarly.
